# Key Lessons from *Bitcoin Stock-to-Flow (S2F) Model* and *Bitcoin Stock-to-Flow Cross Asset (S2FX) Model* by PlanB

## 1. Stock-to-Flow Ratio (S2F) and Bitcoin's Scarcity
- **Lesson**: The Stock-to-Flow (S2F) model evaluates an asset’s scarcity by comparing the stock (existing supply) to the flow (newly produced supply). Bitcoin’s fixed supply and halving cycles make its stock-to-flow ratio increase over time, enhancing its scarcity.
- **Example**: Gold has a high S2F ratio due to its large existing supply relative to new production. Bitcoin’s S2F ratio increases significantly after each halving, reducing new supply and mimicking gold’s scarcity features.

## 2. Bitcoin's Value Based on Scarcity (S2F)
- **Lesson**: The S2F model posits that Bitcoin's value is primarily driven by its scarcity. As Bitcoin’s supply flow diminishes due to the halving events, its value is expected to rise. The model suggests that higher S2F ratios correspond to higher asset valuations.
- **Example**: After the 2020 halving, Bitcoin’s S2F ratio increased to around 56, which PlanB’s model predicted would push Bitcoin’s price toward $100,000 by 2024.

## 3. S2FX Model: Bitcoin as a Cross-Asset
- **Lesson**: The S2FX model extends the original S2F by comparing Bitcoin’s transition from a collectible to a financial asset alongside other assets like silver and gold. It models Bitcoin's progression through different monetary phases based on historical S2F ratios of other assets.
- **Example**: According to the S2FX model, Bitcoin is currently in the early stages of maturing into a financial asset comparable to gold, with the potential to reach much higher valuations as it progresses through the phases.

## 4. Predicting Market Cycles with S2FX
- **Lesson**: The S2FX model uses historical data to predict future Bitcoin price movements by aligning Bitcoin’s maturation with market cycles experienced by other assets like gold and silver. Each phase shift leads to new pricing regimes for Bitcoin.
- **Example**: The model predicts that Bitcoin will follow a price trajectory similar to the adoption of silver and gold. As Bitcoin matures into a global reserve asset, the S2FX model estimates potential future valuations above $288,000.

## 5. Limitations of S2F and S2FX Models
- **Lesson**: While the S2F and S2FX models provide frameworks for understanding Bitcoin’s valuation, critics argue that the models rely heavily on scarcity alone, without considering other factors like demand shocks, regulatory impacts, or technological advancements.
- **Example**: In periods of extreme regulatory pressure or black swan events (e.g., China’s crackdown on Bitcoin mining), Bitcoin’s price may deviate from the predictions of the S2F model.
